### MY PERSONAL TERMINAL
This here is my personal ~~website~~ terminal!?

I've always thought about my own special website.
Not for me and my content (what content?),
but for the design, the coding and the satisfying result.

I've had a few design ideas, including a 3D website,
but I don't have much experience with 3D websites.
Because I like terminals and saw the 404 error page from [kali.org](kali.org),
I developed this simple but cool terminal-like website...
Explore [the system](https://90n45-d3v.github.io) and have fun!
